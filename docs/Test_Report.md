## 1. Introduction

This section provides an overview of the software testing process and the scope of the testing activities. The primary objective of testing GuessMaster is to ensure the quality and reliability of the game by thoroughly assessing its functionality, performance, and user experience. By conducting systematic and comprehensive testing, we aim to identify and rectify any defects or issues that may hinder the game's performance or user satisfaction.

The scope of our testing activities includes examining the significant functions that directly impact gameplay. This encompasses testing various gameplay scenarios, evaluating user interactions, and assessing the accuracy and relevance of the question and answer components. Additionally, we will focus on tracking important files necessary for maintaining the integrity of the game's question and answer database.

## 3. Test Plan

- Test-types: Unit Testing, Smoke Testing
- Target-Test-Coverage: every newly added major function (Smoke testing), 20% (Unit Testing)
- Testing-Tool: Unity Test Framework
- Manage-Test-Cases: Internal Unity test manager; through manual code exchanges different deplyoment versions can be tested

## 4. Test Cases

- In our first tests we check if the CSV file responsible for the questions & answers is present in the resource folder

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functionality

In this subsection, we will explain the different Use Cases with the associated functionalities. The individual Use Cases can be taken from the Use Case Diagram in 2.2.

Until the End of Semester 4 we plan to implement:

- 3.1.1 Gamemode Selection
- 3.1.2 Settings
- 3.1.3 Lobby System
- 3.1.4 The Game itself

#### 3.1.1 Gamemode Selection

This feature is very important for the project as it represents the different ways for a user to enter a game. It is possible to join a public or private game. However, the user has the option to directly create a game by themself too.

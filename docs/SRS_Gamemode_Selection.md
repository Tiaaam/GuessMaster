# Use-Case Specification: Gamemode Selection

## 1. Gamemode Selection

### 1.1 Brief Description
Starting from our landing page our players will have to add their name (or alias) and can then choose from one of three options.
1. When clicking on "Quick Game" they either join an ongoing public game or a public lobby with predefined settings will be opened.
2. Joining a private game for guessing with e.g. friends or colleagues is easy, all you need to know is a code, enter it in the textbox and click on "Join now".
3. If a player wants to create a lobby with custom settings, he/she can do so by simply clicking on the corresponding button. The player will then have some options, including the possibility to choose between a public or private game.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Use-Case-Realization specifies the result-screen as the final part of a game. It shows the order of the players according to the points scored during the game. 

### 1.2 Scope
After the game ends the user gets redirected to a new page. The GuessMaster, the player who scored the most points, is presented ceremonially there and the other players are displayed in a list depending on their points. After leaving the page the player will end up back on the Gamemode Selection.
